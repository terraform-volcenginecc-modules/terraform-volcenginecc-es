# terraform-volcenginecc-es

Terraform Module scaffold for the VolcengineCC provider.

> Status: Scaffold only. The Terraform implementation for this repository is
> not available yet, and this repository is not ready for production use.

## Overview

This repository reserves the module name `volcengine/es/volcenginecc`.

The module is intended to provide a reusable Terraform abstraction for the
`es` scenario using the `volcengine/volcenginecc` provider.

Current scope:

- Repository and module scaffold only.
- No Terraform resources or data sources are currently managed.
- No production-readiness or real-cloud validation claim is made.

## Usage

The module implementation is not available yet. A runnable configuration will
be added together with the first implementation release.

Provider authentication and region configuration must be supplied by the
caller. Do not commit credentials, access keys, secrets, Terraform state, or
plan files.

## Examples

Examples will be added when the module implementation is available.

Planned examples:

- `examples/basic`
- `examples/complete`

## Requirements

| Name | Version |
|---|---|
| Terraform | To be defined with the first implementation |
| `volcengine/volcenginecc` | To be defined with the first implementation |

## Providers

| Name | Source |
|---|---|
| `volcenginecc` | `volcengine/volcenginecc` |

## Resources

No resources or data sources are currently managed.

The resource inventory will be documented before the first release.

## Inputs

No input variables are currently defined.

All inputs will document their type, default value, required status,
validation, ownership, and replacement behavior when implemented.

## Outputs

No outputs are currently defined.

Outputs will document their exact semantics when implemented.

## Notes

- This repository is currently a scaffold and is not a publishable functional
  module.
- Real-cloud validation has not been performed.
- Provider limitations and unsupported scenarios will be documented before
  release.
- Resource ownership, import behavior, replacement behavior, cost risks, and
  cleanup procedures must be documented before the first release.
